You are given ‘n’ items with certain ‘profit’ and ‘weight’ and a knapsack with weight capacity ‘w’.
You need to fill the knapsack with the items in such a way that you get the maximum profit.
You are allowed to take one item multiple times.

Example:
    Input:
    'n' = 3, 'w' = 10,
    'profit' = [5, 11, 13]
    'weight' = [2, 4, 6]

    Output: 27

    Explanation:
        We can fill the knapsack as:

        1 item of weight 6 and 1 item of weight 4.
        1 item of weight 6 and 2 items of weight 2.
        2 items of weight 4 and 1 item of weight 2.
        5 items of weight 2.

        The maximum profit will be from case 3 = 11 + 11 + 5 = 27. Therefore maximum profit = 27.
